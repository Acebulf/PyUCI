PyUCI
=====

The Python UCI Chess Engine Interface (PUCEI or PyUCI) allows communication with a UCI-enabled chess engine from Python 2.x on Unix-based machines.

In very early stages of development.

For an example of use see rungame.py (making an engine play itself.) 

TODO:

* Complete option integration at initialization in engine.py.
* Add non-Unix support.
* Documentation

(... more stuff)
